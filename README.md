# ML Diseased Crop Detection Model

Authors: Gurpreet Singh & Swaroop Sridhar

Objective: Create an efficient ML model that categorizes diseased plants from image data. 

Dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/crop-diseases-classification)

Vision dataset classes:
1. Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
2. Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
3. Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)
4. Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)
5. Healthy

Dataset supports multi-class classification

# TODO
1. Find distribution amongst dataset betwixt classes
